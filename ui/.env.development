# Development Environment Configuration
# Backend API base URL for local development
# 
# NOTE: Leave empty or comment out to enable dynamic API URL detection
# The application will automatically detect whether you're accessing via:
# - localhost/127.0.0.1: Uses Vite proxy (relative URLs)
# - IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x): Constructs full URL with detected IP
# 
# Only set this if you need to override the automatic detection
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5030
